Pareto Anywhere for Azure
=========================

__Pareto Anywhere for Azure__ is the open source middleware that unlocks the value of the [ambient data](https://www.reelyactive.com/ambient-data/) arriving at your Azure IoT Hub.

![Overview of Pareto Anywhere for Azure](https://reelyactive.github.io/pareto-anywhere-azure/images/overview.png)

__Pareto Anywhere for Azure__ runs efficiently as a stateless [Azure Function](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/functions/), triggered by data forwarded from IoT infrastructure, such as [Aruba APs](https://www.reelyactive.com/pareto/anywhere/infrastructure/aruba/), to [Azure IoT Hub](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/iot-hub/).

__Pareto Anywhere for Azure__ provides a single standard stream of real-time data, regardless of the underlying devices & technologies, which include Bluetooth Low Energy and EnOcean Alliance.  Dynamic ambient (__dynamb__) data is output as JSON to [Azure Event Hub](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/event-hubs) from which it is easily relayed to any store, stream processor and/or application.

Getting Started
---------------

Follow our step-by-step tutorial to deploy __Pareto Anywhere for Azure__:
- [Run Pareto Anywhere for Azure](https://reelyactive.github.io/diy/pareto-anywhere-azure/)

Learn "owl" about the __dynamb__ JSON data output:
- [Developer's Cheatsheet](https://reelyactive.github.io/diy/cheatsheet/)

Production Installation
-----------------------

# Codespaces
Each client resource group has an associated CodeSpace.  CLI access to the resource group is possible using the Stored Service Principal

```
cid=$(echo $CLUSTER_SERVICE_PRINCIPAL | jq  -r .clientId)
csecret=$(echo $CLUSTER_SERVICE_PRINCIPAL | jq  -r .clientSecret)
tenant=$(echo $CLUSTER_SERVICE_PRINCIPAL | jq  -r .tenantId)
```
Next these attributes are used to login into the one of the multi-tenant Resource Groups


```
az login --service-principal -u $cid -p $csecret --tenant $tenant
az group list
[
  {
    "id": "/subscriptions/9bb9f5c1-2e1a-4f65-a451-3e60c0a3f1cc/resourceGroups/demo-pareto-poc",
    "location": "westus",
    "managedBy": null,
    "name": "demo-pareto-poc",
    "properties": {
      "provisioningState": "Succeeded"
    },
    "tags": null,
    "type": "Microsoft.Resources/resourceGroups"
  }
]
```
This shows the "walls"  of the configuration.  SO, all resoruces that were provisioned are accessable vis Azure CLI or Github Actions commands
```

Installation
------------

Clone this repository and, from the root of the __pareto-anywhere-azure__ folder, install the package dependencies with the following command:

    npm install

Then, in that same folder, create a file called local.settings.json, and paste in the following contents:

    {
      "IsEncrypted": false,
      "Values": {
        "FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME": "node",
        "AzureWebJobsStorage": "...",
        "EventHubConnectionString": "...",
        "WebPubSubConnectionString": "...",
        "iot_hub_name": "...",
        "event_hub_name": "...",
        "web_pub_sub_hub_name": "..."
      }
    }

Replace the ```"..."``` values with the appropriate strings from the Azure Portal, as explained in our [Run Pareto Anywhere for Azure](https://reelyactive.github.io/diy/pareto-anywhere-azure/) tutorial.


Running locally
---------------

With the Azure CLI installed, run __pareto-anywhere-azure__ locally from its root folder with the following command:

    func start

Then browse to [localhost:7071/app/](http://localhost:7071/app/) to observe data in the web app served by the function.


Running on Azure
----------------

With the Azure CLI installed, push __pareto-anywhere-azure__ to Azure with the following command:

    func azure functionapp publish <APP_NAME>

Initially, and anytime there are changes to local.settings.json, append the flag ```--publish-local-settings -i``` to the above.

Browse to ```<APP_NAME>.azurewebsites.net/app/``` to observe data in the web app served by the function.


Data Structure
--------------

__pareto-anywhere-azure__ outputs events to the Event Hub and to the Web PubSub (for consumption in the web app) using the following structure:

    {
      "type": "dynamb",
      "data": { }
    }

The type is always _dynamb_ (but _raddec_ and _spatem_ can be accommodated in future).  And the data is the _dynamb_ data structure itself: see the [reelyActive Developers Cheatsheet](https://reelyactive.github.io/diy/cheatsheet/) for details.

An example of an event from a temperature & humidity sensor would be as follows:

    {
      "type": "dynamb",
      "data": {
        "deviceId": "ac233f000000",
        "deviceIdType": 2,
        "timestamp": 1645568542222,
        "temperature": 21.77734375,
        "relativeHumidity": 64.90625
      }
    }


Web App
-------

The web app provides an intuitive visualisation of the real-time event stream:

![Pareto Anywhere for Azure web app](https://reelyactive.github.io/pareto-anywhere-azure/images/web-app-screenshot.png)

The web app and all its dependencies are served by the Azure Function itself from the /serveWebApp folder and its subfolders.  Simply edit the index.html file and the dependencies as required, and the changes will appear as soon as the function restarts.

See the [reelyActive Web Style Guide](https://reelyactive.github.io/web-style-guide/) to facilitate customisation, and the [beaver.js](https://github.com/reelyactive/beaver/) and [cuttlefish.js](https://github.com/reelyactive/cuttlefish/) client-side modules which collect and render the real-time dynamic ambient data, respectively.


Project History
---------------

__Pareto Anywhere for Azure__ evolved from [pareto-anywhere](https://github.com/reelyactive/pareto-anywhere/), retaining the stateless processing modules such as the [advlib](https://github.com/reelyactive/advlib) libraries, facilitating efficient operation as a stateless Azure Function.

__pareto-anywhere-azure__ was initially prototyped as [aruba-iot-advlib-azure-function](https://github.com/reelyactive/aruba-iot-advlib-azure-function).
